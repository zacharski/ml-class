    "Most machine learning (ML) algorithms build a model. From the examples in the training set, they build an internal representation, a model, of the relationship between the features and the labels. Once the algorithm builds this model it 'forgets' the individual data instances. Such ML algorithms are called eager learners. On the other hand, a lazy learner does not build a model beforehand. It remembers all the training instances and when it needs to make a prediction on a new instance it then processes all the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "kNN is a lazy learner. During the learning phase, during `fit` it simply remembers the data (it remembers that Gabby Douglas' height is 49 inches and Elena Delle Donne's is 79 ). In the traditional kNN that we have worked through by hand, when we want to make a prediction, we calculate the distance between that new instance and every instance in our training set (how close is this new instance to Gabby Douglas? To Elena Delle Done? And to the 100 other people in our small dataset. As you can imagine, this takes some time. So fitting is fast because it doesn't actually build a model but predicting is slow.\n",

    "### Three kNN algorithms\n",
    "There are three basic kNN algorithms: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **brute** which uses a brute force method we described above.\n",
    "* **kd_tree** which, when you are fitting, creates a binary tree. This makes prediction faster. \n",
    "* **ball_tree** which also creates a binary tree during training (fitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is our first machine learning algorithm, we won't get too bogged down in learning about kd trees and ball trees, but let's cover a few things. First, since the algorithm needs to construct a binary tree when it fits the data, fitting takes longer but with that binary tree, prediction is faster. That is the trade off. For both trees, a binary tree is constructed that divides the training data into a number of sets that have a specific size limit known as leaf size, which is a hyperparameter of the algorithm. When we specify a large leaf size, the depth of the constructed binary tree will be shallow and the amount of time constructing the tree will be reduced. When we specify a smaller leaf size, training time will be increased but predictions will be faster. \n",
