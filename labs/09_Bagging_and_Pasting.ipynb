    "#### The Mary Spender example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say one of your friends mentions over lunch that you would love a particular musical artist on YouTube, say Mary Spender, who you never heard before. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/MarySpender2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the chance that you will actually like Mary Spender's music? Maybe slighly better than chance? Let's say you think there is a 60% chance you will like her. You will file away the recommendation but you are not going to rush home and watch a YouTube video.  Now, in addition to the lunch friend's recommendation,  an old music school friend, now living in Austin messages you saying you should check out Mary Spender and the friend predicts you will absolutely love her. Then a week later, while talking with an old bandmate over the phone, that bandmate, again, recommends Mary Spender. Over the course of less than 10 days, three of your friends independently (because they don't know one another) recommend Mary Spender. Now what is the likelihood of you liking Mary Spender? I am guessing you think that now it is higher than 60%. Maybe now you think it is 90% likely you will like her. It is the aggregate of these 3 people's opinions (3 classifiers) that ups the accuracy of the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/spender22.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to how bagging works. One aggregates the votes of a number of classifiers and the vote of that ensemble of classifiers is more accurate than that of a single classifier. Even if the accuracy of each component classifier is low (known as a weak classifier), the ensemble can be a strong (high accuracy) classifier. Of course there are some caveats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the Mary Spender example. Suppose one of your friends went to a Mary Spender concert and then later in the week met with four other of your friends and mentioned that she thought you would love Mary Spender's music. Then, over the course of a week all those friends recommended Mary Spender to you. In this case the recommendations are not that independent---all are based on one person's opinion. Thus, the accuracy would not be as great as in the example above. Similarly, if you made 10 copies of the exact same classifier each trained on exactly the same data, the accuracy of the ensemble of clones would not be any better than the accuracy of a single copy. Moving away from Mary Spender and our musical tastes and back to machine learning, we can try to create independence among the classifier in 2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can change the type of classifier. For example, we can use a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier with Manhattan distance and a k of 5, a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier with Euclidean distance and a k of 3, a decision tree classifier using entropy and a max depth of 5, and a decision tree classifier with using gini and no max depth specified. Hopefully, the accuracy of the ensemble of the four classifiers would be greater than that of a single classifier.\n",
    "2. We can have an ensemble of the same classifier (for example, 10 decision tree classifiers with identical hyperparameters) but each classifier can get a different subset of the training data. The classifiers would thus build different models (differents 'rules') and, again, the accuracy of the ensemble should be greather than that of a single classifier. This is the approach we will take.\n",

    "Now back to bagging and pasting. In both approaches we are going to sample the training data. Let's say we want 70% of the training data in our sample. In bagging ([Breiman, 1996](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00058655.pdf)), if we our training dataset is 1000 instances and we want 70% for a particular classifier, the algorithm will randomly select 700 out of the 1,000 **with replacement**. With pasting ([Breiman, 1998](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007563306331)), the selection is done **without replacement**. \n",

    "#### but wait, there is more ...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two other options. Instead of selecting a random subset of training data instances, we can select a random subset of columns (features). Let's say we have a dataset of 1,000 instances each with 100 features. When we select a random subset of columns, we still have 1,000 instances but now they have just a subset of the features. This is called Random Subspaces ([Ho, 1998](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b41d/0fa5fdaadd47fc882d3db04277d03fb21832.pdf?_ga=2.196949164.1638238666.1596910000-1073138517.1596910000)).\n",

    "Finally, we can train a classifier on both random subsets of instances and random subsets of features. This is known as Random Patches ([Louppe and Geurts, 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262212941_Ensembles_on_Random_Patches))\n",

    "In summary, the four methods are:\n",

    "* **bagging** - select a subset of data set instances using replacement\n",
