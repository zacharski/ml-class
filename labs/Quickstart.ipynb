    "# A quickstart introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example ...\n",
    "As part of a [conservation effort](http://burrowingowlconservation.org/sightings/), Ann would like to report sightings of Burrowing Owls as she is hiking. Unfortunately, Ann doesn't know what a Burrowing Owl looks like so she goes to the web to look at pictures. What she has then, is a set of images that are labeled. By examining these labeled images she is **training** herself to recognize Burrowing Owls. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/owls2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can call this set of labeled images used for training, the **labeled training dataset**. Let's dive into this idea of a labeled training dataset a bit more. Suppose Clara is given the task of distinguishing between pictures of telecaster style guitars and stratocaster. But not to worry, because her boss has given her thousands of pictures of guitars. When looking at a picture, the only thing Clara knows is that it is of either a stratocaster or a telecaster. For example, here are some pictures of stratocasters and telecasters. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/guitars2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, when looking at a picture all she knows is that it is a picture of a stratocaster or telecaster but she doesn't know which of the two it is. How long will it take for Clara to learn how to distinguish between these two guitar styles? Would the time be significantly shorter if her boss gave her 10,000 pictures or 100,000? If this is all the information she gets, she will never learn. What she needs is a **labeled** dataset. When presented with a picture she needs to know whether it is a picture of a stratocaster or a telecaster. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now back to Ann learning to recognize Burrowing Owls**\n",
    "\n",
    "When Ann is learning to recognize Burrowing Owls from her labeled training set, she is developing a model of what features make it a Burrowing Owl. Once she is done learning she can be on a hike, see an animal, and classify it as a Burrowing Owl or something else. This is an **inference** process---based on the evidence of different features of the animal she can infer what it is. And to throw more jargon at you, this type of problem is called a **classification problem**. In classification problems the system is given the features of an object and it needs to classify that object. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* The features might be the words of a Twitter post (i.e., *Everything Everywhere All At Once was a f-ing masterpiece. I can't emphasize how great this movie is, it's just that great.*) and based on those features the system classifies the post as positve, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "* The features might be the pixels of an image and based on those pixels the system classifies the image into one of 1,000 categories (it's an image of an owl, a bicycle).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## machine learning\n",
    "In machine learning, classification systems have a similar two step process. First is the training phase where the system uses a labeled training dataset to build a model. (We will learn about the architecture of these models and how they learn a bit later.) \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/quickDiagram2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning**. When a machine learning system trains on labeled data this is called supervised learning. When a system learns with unlabeled data this is called unsupervised learning. A very common example of unsupervised learning is clustering where we might give our system a million unlabeled pictures and ask it to divide the images into 10 groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a trained model, we can use that model for inference---we can give it pictures and the system can classify them as burrowing owl or something else. Again, the two phases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. training\n",
    "2. inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction we are going to ignore the training phase and learn a bit about inference. To do that we are going to use a pre-trained model. What *pre-trained model* simply means is that someone else designed the architecture of the model and trained it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretrained model we will use is AlexNet. AlexNet was designed by Alex Krishevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. In 2012, AlexNet won a competition where the competing systems had to classify images into one of 1,000 categories. AlexNet had a 15% error rate and the error rate of the second place winner was over 25%. Since then there are dozens of systems that perform better, but we will use AlexNet because of its historic significance. The pretrained AlexNet was trained on a labeled training dataset of over one million images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First, a note ...\n",
    "The intent of this notebook is for you to learn a little bit about data mining and have a bit of fun. The idea is not for you to understand every line of code. That will come later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**First let's set the runtime to GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) -- click on 'runtime' in the menu above, select 'Change runtime type' and pick 'GPU'.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check to see if we set the runtime to GPU:"
