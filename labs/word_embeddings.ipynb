        "## Meaning\n",
        "For hundreds of years linguists have been investigating how to encode the semantic information of a word. Some belief that there is a universal mental concept, for example `MOON`, with some universal representation in our brains that gets represented in English as *moon* in Uyghur as ئاي, as *Hanhepi wi* in Lakota, and as \n",
        "月 in Japanese. It is also believed that  concepts such as `MOON` and `SUN` share some common semantic features. Similar words would cluster together in semantic space. For example, moon, sun, Mars, Neptune, the Milky Way Galaxy seem to have some similarities and form a group as does a group we could label domestic animals that might include horses, dogs, and cats, which in turn are different from wild animals. So words like *dog*, *cat*, *horse*, have, as part of their semantic meaning, some feature that is the same among these words  and that feature is not present in the representations for the words *moon* or *sun*. These semantic features impact how a word occurs in different contexts. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, it would be rare for a verb to follow the word *the*:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *The says ...\n",
        "* *The haven't\n",
        "* *The see\n",
        "\n",
        "(Here the asterisk * represents a sentence most people would find odd). And again, this is just probability. Certainly, you can construct sentences that have these sequences that are perfectly fine (*The says who questioning method .*, *Just experimenting with the Says Who basics on myself on with clients*, *The haven't had time excuse*). But the likelihood of the word *says* following *the* is extremely rare. \n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, sentences like\n",
        "\n",
        "* I fed my ___\n",
        "* I fed my dog\n",
        "* I fed my poodle\n",

        "\n",
        "> You shall know a word by the company it keeps\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is a simple one. If we find a bunch of words that can follow the sequence *I fed my* we can assume that they share some semantic feature. And, if we didn't know English we could still do this analysis. We wouldn't know that the feature is domestic animal but we would know that they share some feature, let's call it x29. This, as we talked about is a latent feature.\n",
        "\n",

So let's say column 1 was *a* and 2 *the*, and 7,253 *computer* and so on. If we encode a sentence that starts *the computer*, the word *the* would be represented by a '1' in column 1 and zeroes in the other 9,999 columns. The word *computer* would have a '1' in column 7,253 and zeroes in the other 9,999. That is an awful lot of zeroes, and this vector is called **sparse**.
