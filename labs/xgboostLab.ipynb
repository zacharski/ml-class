        "Next we create a second decision tree classifier and as part of its training data we will use the instances that Classifier got wrong. Now Classifier 2 isn't perfect either and there will be some instances that both Classifier 1 and Classifier 2 got wrong, and, you guessed it, we will use those instances as part of the training data for Classifier 3.\n",

        "#### 400 Classifiers\n",
        "Suppose we created 400 classifiers using the bagging algorithm. Since each classifier is independent of the others, we can run those 400 in parallel. \n",
