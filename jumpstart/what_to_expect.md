# What to expect from the class.

First, hello, and welcome to the class.

During the first class session of a normal semester I usually say something like "I think you will find this course challenging but a lot of fun." The 'challenging' part will be doubly true this semester as we are adjusting to an online course. But I am hoping we don't lose sight of the 'fun' aspect of the course.

The first time I taught an online course was over 25 years ago when I taught Introduction to Computational Linguistics for the Linguistics Department at the University of Minnesota while I was working in a computational linguistics lab and living in New Mexico. This semester I still am living in New Mexico (Santa Fe) and will help guide you through the course material wherever you are situated whether it is in Florida, Virginia or elsewhere.  (Keep in mind that I am on Mountain TIme!)

## Videos and Interactive notebooks and projects

The content of the course is in the form of  video screencasts from the [Inquiryum Machine Learning Fundamentals Course](http://inquiryum.com/machine-learning/) and interactive Python notebooks. These are described a bit in the class syllabus but let me elaborate.

### Video Screencasts

The videos often come in pairs: One video explains the theory of an algorithm the other is a hands-on one where I talk through how to code and use the algorithm. For example, there is a video on how a decision tree algorithm works. In the next video I show you how to code a decision tree classifier in Python. 

### Interactive Jupyter Notebooks

For each pair of videos, there is an associated interactive notebook that covers the same material using different examples. So if the video was unclear, hopefully the notebook will make it more clear. The syllabus describes the notebooks, which I also call labs, as:

* In the form of Jupyter Notebook tutorials which provide detailed explanations and sample executable code. 
* You are to:
  * write a small amount of code to complete the task
  * answer any non-coding questions the Notebook may ask.

The notebooks are designed to be a step-by-step guide to some topic. You will submit the notebook for points. There are approximately 15 of these notebooks.

### Projects

After we finish a module of these video/notebook topics, you will be working on a project. The projects are underspecified, meaning I don't give you detailed instructions of what to do. You can see the instructions to the first project [here](https://github.com/zacharski/ml-class/blob/master/projects/Bach.md). It is your chance to apply what you learned in the module. These are also submitted for points. 

### 

## Slack check-in

Twice per week one of our Slackbots in our Slack channel will ask you three questions:

1. What have you accomplished since the last the last Slack check-in?
2. What are you working on now?
3. What is holding your back?

You will be responsible to log into our Slack channel and answer these questions.

Failure to do the Slack check-in also counts as missed attendance.

You can lose XP by not checking in. 

- first and second missed check-in: no loss of points
- third missed check-in - 10xp
- fourth missed check-in - 25xp
- fifth -100xp
- sixth: -250xp

If I see you are stuck on a particular problem, I will contact you.
