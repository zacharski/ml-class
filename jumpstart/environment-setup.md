## Notes



### Text Editors

A text editor is a computer program that allows you to create and edit files that contain plain text. This is different than a robust word processing program like Microsoft Word, or Google Docs. When you're writing computer code, you don't need or want any special formatting to be part of the file. In fact, your code probably won't work at all unless it was written and saved in a plain text environment.

Text editors are commonly used by web designers and developers because it provides maximum flexibility to create just about anything. A text editor is not the same thing as an integrated development environment(IDE). While almost every IDE has the capability of creating and editing plain text documents, they also include a wealth of other features and powerful capabilities.

As the installfest below illustrates, we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our official text editor at Inquiryum.  In the future all projects will be written in VS Code.  

**NOTE** VS Code has a terminal screen.  We ask you **not** to use it.  Instead maintain a separate terminal window when you write code at Ada.  It will help with your workflow.  

**NOTE 2** You've probably been required to use vi, vim, or emacs in another class. When you are developing code you don't want the editor to hinder you. Instead, you want the editor to fit like a glove and to be super comfortable with it. You don't want to be stumbling over some archaic vim command instead of focusing on the task of writing code. Again, the official editor for the course is VS Code.

## Installfest

### Installing git, VS Code, nvm, npm, and node.

In the Inquiryum Backend Developer Fundamentals course we have an [installfest](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/00-programming-fundamentals/installfest.md) prepared which will walk you through installing all the software required to start at Ada.

**Make sure to complete the installfest exercise linked above**
